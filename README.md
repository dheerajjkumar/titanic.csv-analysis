Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset in the field of data analysis and machine learning. The dataset contains demographic and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

Project Highlights
Utilized fundamental Python libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib for basic plotting
seaborn for advanced statistical visualizations
plotly for creating interactive plots
Employed essential functions such as:

pd.describe() and pd.info() for dataset summaries
count() and sum() for data aggregation
isnull() for identifying missing values
ffill() and bfill() for filling missing data
mean() for calculating averages
plt.bar() for creating bar charts
Explored factors influencing passenger survival rates based on attributes like age, gender, and ticket class.
